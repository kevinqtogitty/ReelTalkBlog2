    Do you hate/love culture-less upper middle class white people in their early twenties? If like me, you revel in the seeing yuppies trying to navigate their post collegiate years in the big city then I think Last Days of Disco might be for you. Coming off the heels of Metropolitan & Barcelona Whit Stillman rounds out his trilogy with his ever-so superficial cast of characters, witt, and manners, this time set in the dying era of the Manhattan disco scene.

    Some background. Set somewhere around the early 80’s, folk and hippie culture had died a much needed death. I mean how much political folk music can one consume before everytime you hear a new song you ask yourself “is this a new Simon and Garfunkel tune?”. Disco, although short-lived, ruled the 70’s with catchy hit after hit blasting through the flashing floors of nightclubs. Working alongside films like Saturday Night Fever, Disco Fever, and Skate Town USA it seemed like the discotheques were unstoppable. Bursting from the the underground dance scene of the late 60’s, rock music stans despised the simple and mechanical sounds of their big-haired and boogie-oogie counterparts (and lets be honest were slightly racist as disco emerged from black culture).

    The hatred of disco came to its zenith on Thursday July 12th 1979 when Steven Dahl, a radio host, held an event called “Disco Demolition Night” at an MLB game in Chicago. People were encouraged to bring disco records they wanted to see destroyed with explosives during a break in the evening games. Expecting only 20,000 attendees that night, 50,000 actually showed up when the capacity of Chicagos Comiskey Park was only around 40,000. When the first crate of disco records blew up 5,000-7,000 people rushed the field which quickly devolved into a riot.

    Movies made about disco after the era are few and far between, but Last Days of Disco surely stands as the few that celebrate the culture through a different lens and without the stereotypical accoutrements.

    By day recent graduates of Hampshire College Alice and Charlotte work at a publishing house in Manhattan, and by night they don their shiniest outfits and hit the most exclusive nightclub in town scouting for tolerable/eligible men. Their clubbing cohort consists of a coworker of theirs, an accountant, one of the managers of the studio 54 like venue they visit, an assistant district attorney, a desperate junior ad man, their quiet roommate, and an environmental lawyer, all of whom are Harvard grads.

    Just like in Whit Stillman fashion the film revolves mostly around the intellectual discourse between the characters ranging from dated-dating advice to a rather passionate full-on dissection of the Disney film Lady and the Tramp (yes, and its hilarious). What makes Stillmans characters so entertaining is that although they might attend Ivy-league schools and socialize in circles whose individual incomes are well above the average Americans’, they’re still dealing with the same problems as everyone else. Albeit they don’t even know that themselves.

    Chock full of quotable lines like:

    &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; __“Theres something really sexy about scrooge McDuck”__

    &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; __“I’m not an addict, I’m a habitual user”__

    &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; __“A lot of people won’t take no for an answer. I wanted you to know that I’m not <br /> &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; one of them. I can be discouraged.”__

    If you’re a fan of victorian era comedys of manners like Oscar Wildes The Importance of Being Earnest then you’ll surely fall in love with Last Days of Disco, and to be honest all of his works. What I think makes Stillman one of my favorites is that his vision of American white upper-class struggles sits at the door of satire. As in it’s not entirely ridiculous in its premise. Nor is he trying to take down the culture of which his films revolve around, it’s that the characters lack a somewhat healthy amount of self-awareness (especially of their bourgeois nature) that causes the lines that come out of their mouths to sound ludicrous. Having been a Harvard graduate himself, it allows him to write from lived experience and memory instead of research and consultants to advise him. As a fan of Jane Austen and her contemporaries you’ll notice a politeness in Stillmans film even when they’re dishing out the harshest insults at each other. With stage-like acting and delivery it’s not hard to see why Stillman and his films are loved by those in-the-know.

    I was struggling to find the right words to encapsulate Stillmans unique style, but Michael Newton who writes for the Guardian I think already said it perfectly; it’s courteous comedy.
