<article class="main-content">

What if I told you there were two reclusive souls living in a derelict home in the East Hamptons NY, surrounded by wildly growing greenery? Would you poke your head round and figure out what the hell was going on in that haunted looking house? I think you’d be surprised at what you found. Not because you’d stumble upon a bunch of creepy old ghost and supernatural occurrences, but because you’d meet two of the most quirky and larger than life characters hiding in plain sight.

          That’s what the Maysles brothers discovered when Lee Radziwill, younger sister of Jackie Kennedy, took them up to visit her relatives, the Beales, at their estate _Grey Gardens_. Originally intending to do a documentary funded by Radziwill on her and her family, the Maysles found the Beales to be much more interesting in front of their cameras. Over the course of a year they captured a complex and remarkable relationship between Edith "Big Edie" Bouvier Beale and her daughter, Edith "Little Edie" Bouvier Beale. It’s an intimate portrait between mother and daughter, their hopes and regrets with a dash of singing and dancing.


          Once the center of attention in high society Big and Little Edie dropped out of the limelight, living the rest of their lives secluded in _Grey Gardens_ on dwindling funds. Surrounded by other wealthy Hamptons residents _Grey Gardens_ became the weird kid on the block, their reputation born from the duo having falling from grace and now living in poverty on a decaying estate. But what makes _Grey Gardens_ so great is the fact that although we are appalled by the abject squalor, we’re drawn in and completely won over because of the vibrant personalities of the Beales, and that’s what makes _Grey Gardens_ such an enduring documentary about the human spirit.

           Big Edie now a late senior was once a singer on the stage; a youthful portrait of her painted and framed now sits in the corner of their bedroom where the cats pee behind. Little Edie on the other hand, and total eccentric and adorable oddball, was a fashionista and dance in her bygone years, the film established her as a fashion icon — dawning a multitude of headscarves paired with makeshift skirts and stockings. Several cats, raccoons, and various other creatures moved in with the Bouviers as the walls began to crack; there’s a rather odd and hilarious scene in which Little Edie heads up to the attic to feed the raccoons by dumping box of cat chow on a pile of Wonderbread on the floor.

Having been such an intimate documentary it was subject to much criticism due to what many thought was an exploitative feature. But how could it be? What we take away from the film is, it’s not about being rich and wealthy, but feeling it. It’s about keeping your spirits high in the worst of times, even when the is nowhere in sight. Although sometimes we see mother and daughter get into heated arguments, they’re almost always followed by a bit of singing and dancing. There isn’t much to report about the film because it’s simply a film about being OK with we’re you’re at, especially in times like this where the world seems to have come to a halt and all of our plans have been thrown out the window. It’s the little things that keep you going, create your own little world full of good music, some dancing, a few close friends and a good relationship with your family, and maybe even a rodent or two will make the trouble and regrets you once had fade into a distant memory.
