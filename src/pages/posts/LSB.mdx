When _Kill Bill_ first came out in the early 2000’s Tarantino had already become a household name, shooting him up alongside Spielberg and Scorsese. It’s safe to say that _Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2_ are his most accessible films for those who want to get into his work or those who are looking just to have a fun movie night with friends. I for one didn’t know all the details surrounding the films’ references to Japanese action and revenge films of which the it’s based on. And then along came _Lady Snowblood_, which made _Kill Bill_ all the more sense and enjoyable. The film itself being an adaption of a Japanese manga of the same name, written by Kazuo Koike from 1972-1973.

          Adapted for the screen and directed by Toshiya Fujita, _Lady Snowblood_ is a multi-generational revenge film full of creative energy and style all its own. It takes place after the end of Japans isolationist Edo period and the beginning of the Meiji era. This period was marked by Japans rapid urbanization and increased contact with the west, making it as much a tale about karmic vengeance as it is about a Japans entrance into the modern world.

          The film opens in the middle of a snowy night, the cries of baby reverberating through the wooden walls of a womans prison. Surrounded by several other women dressed in crimson red robes, lies a mother nearing death beside her newborn. Through the mothers burning desire to exact revenge on the criminals who raped her and killed her family, she birthed Yuki, a demigod destined to carry out her mothers bloodthirst. Snowfall turning bright red, as if it were droplets of blood raining down from the sky signals the carnage we’re about to witness. Flashing forward twenty years Yuki has grown up to be the beautiful assassin her mother dreamt of, characterized by her porcelain white skin, eyes as deep as her rage, and signature umbrella she roams the mountainous country searching for her mothers perpetrators.


          Yuki, played by the Japanese action star Meiko Kaji, just might be the most savage and ruthless female protagonist to ever grace the screen. She is what is known in the film as an Asura, one of the four unhappy births in Hindu/Buddhist texts. The life of an Asura is amoral, and nothing can stand in the way of her bloody retribution. The film jumps between past and present, revealing the history of Yuki’s intense training in the mountains by the priest Dokai, and her mothers backstory before she ended up at the prison. We learn one day on a walk with her husband and son, Yuki’s family was ambushed by a gang of criminals, her father and young brother brutally murdered leaving her mother to be raped and taken as a prisoner for the leader. After having moved to Tokyo with her captor, she finally finds the right moment to murder him which lands her in the womens prison. Unable to escape to find the other three who did her wrong, she seduces the prison guards to bear a child in the hopes that it’d carry out her vengeance.


          In the scenes where Yuki swings her blade against the flesh of her enemies, the camera matches and moves with intentional speed. Fujita uses handheld closeups to amplify Yuki’s strength and skill by forcing our attention to her enemies gushing wounds, and still closeups on peoples eyes building tension and anticipation of what’s to come. From dutch angles to extremely fast zooms and even still photos, Fujita uses an array of techniques to keep the film moving with a firm grasp on our attention. The colors of white and red are prominently on display throughout the film, Yuki walks on fresh layers of snow in her spotless white kimono, and the only thing ever splashed across the bed of powder and her dress, blood. Her otherworldly beauty draws her enemies in close, thinking they’ve got an easy kill, only to be met by a merciless master samurai.


          The final chapter of the film sees Yukis enemies go from sword wielding villagers to gun-slinging capitalists. Purposefully placing _Lady Snowblood_ at a pivotal point in Japans history adds to it’s authentic portrayal of Japan and reminds us that although Yuki is a master when it comes to a battle between the blades, she’s still mortal and can be beaten by a bullet to the heart. The final years of Edo period Japan saw the demise of the samurai class. Once needed to protect private lands and villages, this prosperous time in Japans history didn’t require the services of the once highly regarded warriors. In turn samurai were forced to wander from village to village as guns for hire, eventually retiring their swords and becoming part of civil society. This coupled with Japan opening its doors to western trade and ways of life put the last nail in the coffin for the warrior class. Swords were replaced with guns, Kabuki replaced with masquerades, and the introduction of western production pushed Japan to rapidly industrialize. This economic boom in Japan brought great change both bad and good, ultimately making japan the first non-western country to emerge as great world power.

          This idea of westernization is embodied by Gishirō Tsukamoto, who faked his own death to avoid Yuki’s eventual hunt for him. He dawns circular shades and a western haircut under his English bowling hat, and explains that he’s been involved in arms dealing between the Europe and Japan. There is also a mention of a historic building called Rokumeikan, which was a controversial building that physically manifested Japans fear of westernization. Ultimately Yuki gets her way and finishes her mission, narrowly surviving a gunshot to the abdomen she stumbled out into the snowy field and comforted by the cold against her skin. Yuki represents Japan long before foreign ships ever touched the shores of the country, her devotion to exact vengeance is reminiscent of the samurais devotion to their way of life, Bushido. Her success symbolizing Japan rich and enduring culture in times of extreme and difficult changes.


          Dynamic and rich, full of spectacular violence, and a great revenge story with plenty of plot twists to boot, _Lady Snowblood_ offers a cinematic ride like no other. No wonder Tarantino had to do an homage to it.

Alexa, play _Flowers of Carnage_.
