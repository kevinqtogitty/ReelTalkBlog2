With a multi-generational family drama Mia Hansen-Love explores the aftermath of a tragic event and it effects on the people closest. With realistic approach _Father of My_ Children builds on hints, small moments that add up to the climax and she does it so subtly and explicit at the same time. The film centers around a film producer and his wife and three children as he struggles to balance his time between work and family. Its a powerful film that has two voices, the voices of the actors — literally — and their actions, and then there’s the voice of whats happening inside their heads that’s magnificently done with static shots of quiet contemplation.

          Hansen-Love lets us in on the silent desperation many live in. It’s done through a looming sense of dread, but then offset momentarily by the heartwarming scenes of a loving family. Love understands the power of realism, what we see onscreen is relatable and, for lack of a better word, unremarkable, but at the same time it sets us up for, well… whatever the twist or unforeseen event the director has planned.

Here my top 5 favorite things about _Father of My_ Children

# 1. The Realism

- Masterfully done, it’s reminiscnet of Mike Leigh and 2000’s cinema. A study of family and the rearrangement of duties and the strength between blood.

# 2. The Multiple Viewpoints

- With her family study we get to follow around several characters. Allowing the viewer to experience multiple viewpoints not only expands the branches of the narrative, but it shows us different perspectives on a singular subject.

# 3. The Child Actors

- Wow. These kids are incredible, the emotions Hansen-Love manages to pull out of her child actors are powerful.

# 4. The Explicit and Implicit

- As stated above, its a film that speaks when there are no lines. The dual language allows us to interpret the atmosphere, emotions, and thoughts that spoken lines could not.

# 5. The aftermath and waves that reverberate

- After the climax it the side characters shift into focus and we’re able to see them react, respond, and even grow. We see them dealing with the shift in family structure, and how each person copes differently
