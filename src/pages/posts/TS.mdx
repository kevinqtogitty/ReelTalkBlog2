Death comes for all of us eventually, will you be ready to face it in those final moments? What would you sacrifice to do it all over again? What would you sacrifice to save those you loved? What would you sacrifice to save the world? What would you sacrifice to save yourself? Knowing his time was running out on earth after a long battle with lung cancer, Tarkovsky made _The Sacrifice_. His last hurrah and contribution to the the art form he dedicated his life to. It poses man on his knees at the feet of death. Have we squandered our lives away only to be spiritually unprepared to face the end?

          Tarkovsky tried to shoot it on the island of Faro, of which Swedish film titan Ingmar Bergman resided, but got denied by the Swedish government. It was even shot by Bergmans cinematographer Sven Nykvist . His films dealt with the silence of God, and mans struggle to find higher meaning. No doubt a nod to a master contemporary, Tarkovsky brought his own poetic voice to a similar theme.


          The film centers around a birthday celebration of an elderly writer Alexander (Erland Josephson), surrounded by his family and close friends on his luxurious rural property. Alexanders company consists of his wife Adelaide (Susan Fleetwood) an actress, his stepdaughter Marta (Filippa Franzén), his mute son nicknamed “Little Man” (Tommy Kjellqvist), Victor (Sven Wollter) the tired and annoyed family physician, the superstitious local postman Otto (Allan Edwall), and lastly his two maid the younger Julia (Valérie Mairesse) and the older Maria (Guðrún Gísladóttir).  As the sun begins to set, low flying jets dart across the island, World War III has begun. The group sits around the table petrified by the news of the impending nuclear holocaust, Adelaide unable to control her emotions falls into a hysteric fit fearful of the end of days. Alexander, seemingly disconnected to everyone, drifts away to reflect on his relationship with faith, eventually breaking down in a moment of desperate prayer. Can his willingness to give up everything he knows be enough for God to answer cries?


           Nietzsche’s Eternal Return thought experiment is mentioned early in the film; In short it’s the idea that we are stuck in this rebirth cycle, forced to live our lives over and over again with no recollection of the previous. It’s meant to ask us “are you satisfied with your life and how it’s been going?” because you might just have to live it repeatedly for the rest of eternity. We learn of Adelaide’s discontent in marrying Alexander who gave up on his acting to become a critic. And Victor who’s sick and tired of being the personal doctor, so much so he decides to take a position in the far corners of Australia. We’ve all got our mistakes, but let us not wait till the end of our lives to recognize that we could’ve taken action and changed course. We must live with our choices, whether or not a benevolent God will accept our desperate acts of faith in the face of death.


          _The Sacrifice_ has all the Tarkovsky hallmarks from his famed long slow poetic takes to his signature dreamlike atmosphere in all its metaphysical glory. There are a few moments that stick out for me; A scene in which, we are unable to distinguish if its a dream or reality, the ground and its foliage are being blown by a strong wind which almost looks like a its being wiped away by a nuclear explosion; Of course the iconic scene where Alexander burns down his home, watching the group lose control and break down for 6 minutes as the fire consumes the building. It’s a powerful and emotionally charged scene near the end that sets up the rather tranquil and inquisitive final scene of Little Man watering his Japanese tree.

          Tarkovsky sought to make films not to pose ideas but to force us to reflect on our human existence. His films often pose mans intellect at odds with mans naive, and often unwilling, understanding of the spiritual self. Often described as a visual poet _The Sacrifice_ was his coming to terms with his mortality, sharing with us a personal and spiritual journey, his final goodbye. It’s a journey that we must all embark sooner or later. And he’s given us a hell of a head start.
