<article class="main-content">
 *Le Samourai* gave birth to one of the most recognized characters in recent film history. Tall, quiet, handsome, and deadly are the traits associated with Alain Delons character Jef Costello, always dressed in a smart suit under his belted trench and grey fedora; A modern samurai. A bird caged beside his bed, wardrobe with one suit and several bottles of evian placed on top, and a mirror to check his hat before he exits through the door are the only things that decorate his apartment. The opening shot sees Costello laying on his bed puffing his cigarette as the samurais Bushido code appears on screen,

“There is no greater solitude than that of the samurai, unless it is of that of the tiger in the jungle...perhaps.”
— Bushido
The film centers around Jef Costello, a contract killer, who after a hit comes into the suspicion of the Parisian police. After completing the job he arrives at the rendezvous to receive payment but instead gets crossed and barely survives a stray bullet to the arm, now injured and on his own he must find who ordered his assassination while dodging the cops at every turn. Here are my top 5 favorite things about this film

# 1. The color palette

- Melville turns Paris into a cold and heartless town through his sheer choice of color. restricting the film to the colors of blue, beige, grey, and white drains Paris of all it’s romance and warmth that we usually think of when we think of the city.

# 2. The melding of several cultures

- Melville was heavily influenced and a fan of Hollywood Noir/American gangster films and its obviously reflected in the types of films he makes. But his american/french infusion is taken a step further by adopting a character whose whole persona is based on the way of the samurai. The honor and control he has, with the mastery of his weapon (in this case revolver) echo the long forgotten way of the samurai.

# 3. The cat and mouse

- It’s not just a film about a man running away from the cops, but a man who’s caught in between. His existence is threatened by both the authorities and the mystery gangsters that hire him. He is simultaneously dodging and going after and unknown enemy.

# 4. The women

- Being that it is a noir film one would expect a femme fatale, the women in _Le Samourai_ inhabit a different role. Instead of being the quick-witted and dangerous romantic interest they are in essence the only ones who can save him. Jane Lagrange is the prostitute that he depends on for air-tight alibis, his need for her, as she says, gives her a meaning. His need for her isn’t sexual like everybody else’s, his need for her is of utmost importance for his survival. And of course the pianist Valerie, the one that saves him from being convicted at the police station, and the one who allows him to escape the hell his life had turned into.

# 5. The ambiguity of the ending

- Many would be confused at the ending. I won’t spoil it here, but it involves a dramatic build up to a symbolic ending. Perhaps it was a way to save Jane and from the police finding out she lied, because he actually did love her. Or maybe it was his only way out, for how long can a man keep running?
