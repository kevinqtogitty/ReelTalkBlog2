<article class="main-content">

Having been born several years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, I can only recall stories of family members and friends huddled around the television tuned into CBS to witness the unification of East and West Germany. A monumental moment in modern history, and for the German people, a new chapter. The depth and meaning of it was something I never fully understood until my late teens, and even now Berlins tumultuous history is second to its tech industry and its young and hip culture. But what was life like before that? This is the setting for Wim Wenders _Wings of Desire_, or it’s more fitting German title Der Himmel über Berlin (The Sky/Heaven Over Berlin), which takes places two years before the Berlin Wall fell. Inspired after reading Duino Elegies by Rainer Maria Rilke, the concept of suffering and lamenting angels pushed him to create a poetic love letter to the city of Berlin— its people, history, and future— all felt, heard and celebrated.

           Coming off the heels of his colorful road trip masterpiece Paris, Texas, Wenders ventures from the vast west Texas landscape to the overcast and politically charged capital of Berlin. In _Wings of Desire_, we are cast into the the perspective of angels, roaming the city from one person to the next as they lend their ears and listen to the inner thoughts of the mortal people. Hearing everything from random musings to ones hopes and fears, the angels rejoice when humanity finds joy and peace, and hurt when humanity finds only woe and war. The main story follows Damiel, played brilliantly by Bruno Gonz, an angel whose childlike curiousity towards the human experience leads him to fall in love with a trapeze artist. Tired of his infinite action-less existence, he trades in his wings and immortality to finally experience the sweet and small moments along with the grand pleasures of human life.


          In the film, the angels often sit beside humans with one hand on their shoulder and an open ear, sometimes they walk alongside them as invisible companions, and sometimes they appear to merely laugh with us at our inner jokes. With his youthful sensibilities Damiel often finds himself admiring the endless supply of optimism and freedom of children. One day his curiosity leads him to a circus where he becomes enamored by the grace and beauty of Marion a french trapeze artist who coincidentally also dawns a pair of wings. Her dreams of making big as a circus performer are crushed when the troupe learns that they haven’t been making enough money to pay their bills. In an effort to console her Damiel listens in on her thoughts, her dreams and fears for the future, and finding out that the woman he’s fallen for also contains a characteristic he himself is unfamiliar with, resilience.


          In between the main plot following Damiel and Marion, are several other subplots. One being Cassiel a fellow angel, played by Otto Sanders, who silently accompanies a senior throughout the film aptly named in the script as “Homer.” He listens as the ageing man recounts memories of war, tries to remember his way around town, and thoughts on the current generation and the future of humanity. The other major subplot follows Peter Falk as himself, filming a new episode of his long running show Colombo in Berlin as he reflects on his acting career while drawing portraits of extras in between takes. Damiel, amused by Peter Falk’s observations and persona, often pays him a visit and one day, to his surprise, is sensed by the actor. It’s revealed later on that Falk this whole time was once an angel himself, having chosen to fall to earth as well. He’s built built himself up as a man of the arts and pushes Damiel to experience the life for himself instead of asking for all the answers.


          Exquisitely shot in black and white and color, it reverses The Wizard of Ozs’ environmental color shift. In the supernatural world, the world of angels, everything is seen through monochromatic eyes which invokes a feeling of timelessness in a dull world. When color is used, it signals the perspective change from the supernatural realm to the mortal world. And it does this strongly so when Damiel turns in his wings and suddenly the color fades into the frame. And just to reinforce the importance of color in both his work and the medium, Wenders gives us a joyful scene in which Damiel tries to differentiate the various colors painted onto the Berlin Wall.


          Human expression is at the heart of this film, to act, to paint and draw, to perform, and to sing. These acts allow us to become closer with ourselves, with our ideas and emotions. Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds make several appearances throughout the film, their music naturally echoing the themes of love, religion, and death presented in _Wings of Desire_. Marion among the other attendees find comfort in Nick Caves raw live performances, his concerts acting like a religious gathering with the angels standing  by his side on the stage. I believe it is through the artistic form that allows us to press pause and transcend our sober lives, giving way for us to experience the things we love in a divine and spiritual way.


          _Wings of Desire_ is first and foremost a humanistic film. At the same time it doesn’t shy away from showing us the darker sides of humanity, the things we do to each other and the things we do to ourselves. It allows us to see and feel the whole range of the human experience in a single sitting, and part of that includes scenes that are emotionally hard to watch. But with that said it pushes forward the idea that humanity can overcome anything, whether we fall on hard times or whether we are at the mercy of our own sinister thoughts. It is a celebration of the human will to keep on living, searching for higher meaning through human expression, and the universal desire to be heard and loved by another. Two years after the film was released, the Berlin Wall came crashing down. Families reunited, new opportunities appeared, and an overwhelming sense of ‘'anything thing is possible” swept across a nation and the rest of world.
