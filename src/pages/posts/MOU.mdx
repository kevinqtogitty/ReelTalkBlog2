Set between the Bay of Pigs invasion and the events leading up to the Cuban Missile Crisis, Tomás Gutiérrez Alea’s film _Memories of Underdevelopment_ follows Sergio, a rather unsavory Cuban upperclassman, as he drifts around the rapidly declining city of Havana. Adapted from Edmundo Desnoe’s Memorias del subdesarrollo, and heralded as one of Cuba’s greatest cinematic contributions to world of film, the story of Sergio is a conduit for the story of sociopolitical changes that Cuba underwent at the beginning of Castro’s’ reign. _Memories of Underdevelopment_ explores the psyche of a man unable to let go of his pre-revolutionary bourgeoisie ideas as he tries to resist the winds of change sweeping across Cuba, inevitably leaving him alienated from the rest of his countrymen.

          As his wife and relatives flee Cuba for the states, Sergio remains in his posh Havana apartment. An aspiring writer, he lounges around drinking coffee, spying on the city through his telescope, and fantasizing about his maid. Occasionally stepping out onto the raggedy streets of Havana to exchange sexual gazes with strange women he passes by. Through Sergio’s POV we follow him around with his thoughts, discovering his sexist views of women, his passive and blind approval of imperialism through his obsessions of all things European, and his general indifference to the tense political climate he is swallowed up in.

Thoughts and observations
The title alone gives us an understanding, that to Sergio, everything related to Cuba is primitive. Its people, politics, and culture are second to his European ideal. There’s quite a funny scene in which he attends a roundtable discussion on the underdevelopment of Cuban literature. The panel, consisting of 4 Cuban writers, debate the way in which underdeveloped countries are portrayed by its own Authors. Edmundo Desnoes being one of the panel guests is subject to Sergio’s’ thoughts, only to be interrupted by an American pointing out the irony of an “archaic” form of debate on revolutionary topics.

          The films criticism of class is especially apparent in his relationship with Elena, a young aspiring actress, whom he meets off the street one day. Dissatisfied by her conservative Cuban ways he attempts to anglicize her; taking her to bookstores, visiting Hemingway’s home turned museum, and an art gallery all with the hope that she transforms herself. We learn through a flashback of his fleeting romance with Hanna, a German refuge, that he once had experienced the sophistication and grace that he so desperately desires from Cuban women. Eventually she returns to Europe leaving him clinging to her memory and searching for her in the Cuban women he philanders about with.

            Running away from feelings of disgust associated with memories of his youth spent at brothels, he seeks to elevate his social standing amongst Cuban society. And as the events and looming sense of doom intensify surrounding nuclear war, so does Sergio’s feeling of alienation. Eventually he succumbs to his past as it catches up to him and makes a familiar remark about himself that he does early on the film about women as they age.


          The film ends with Sergio in his pajamas aimlessly walking around his apartment intercut with real life footage of the Cuban military loading tanks and artillery onto the street of Havana. Signaling the end of both Sergio’s ideal and an era.

\*\*Conclusion
By the time this film had been released it’d already been several years since the end of Cuban Missile Crisis. The sentiments towards radical and revolutionary change that Sergio held of that era were well understood by the Cuban people. _Memories of Underdevelopment’s_ enduring significance in world cinema lies with it’s ability, past and present, to give the rest of the world a glimpse into a unique and strange collective conscious.

          The first person perspective coupled with a protagonist we all loathe allows the audience to grasp and understand the peculiar thought processes of not just Sergio, but a group of people. A group that had lived and experienced Cuba as a playground for high society. Unable to accept the truth that the glitz and glamour Havana experienced under Fulgencio Batista, was due to the fact he exploited his people and country for financial gain.

            _Memories of Underdevelopment_ takes influence from the Italian Neorealism and French New Wave style while intercutting newsreels, documentary footage, voiceover, flashbacks, and dream sequences to create an experimental and powerful film exploring a defining moment in Cuban history.
