    Often cited as the film that started the New Wave movement in Taiwan, Edward Yangs 1983 modernist film **That Day, on the beach*, which was also the directors first feature, showcases what would be his signature visual style and themes.As with all of Yangs works, **That Day, on the Beach* focuses on city life in Taipei, the battle between western influence and Chinese tradition, self-discovery, city living, and the complexities of family life.

    **That day, on the Beach* tells the story of two friends who reunite after 13 years apart. Tan (Terry Hu), a concert pianist returns to her home of Taipei for a performance after having spent the last 13 years in Europe. She receives a lunch invitation from Jia-li (Sylvia Chang) an old high school friend whose brother she dated years ago. The film is primarily told through lengthy flashbacks of Jia-Li’s life up until the present moment. The main driver of Jia-Li’s flashbacks are to recount her life with her husband De-Wei, who several years ago mysteriously disappeared at the beach.

    This distance and vagueness is a hallmark of the modernist film movement as it treats plot as just one of the many malleable characteristics of the cinematic form. Modernism itself emerged in the mid to late 19th century, but wouldn’t make it into the world of film until after the second World War. This post-war movement in film rejected realism in favor for experimentation of the form its author worked in. Joyce with Ulysses, a modern retelling of Homers The Odyssey, experimented heavily with stream of consciousness prose, symbolism, self-reflection, and even traced the english language itself. Painters like O’Keefe, Pollock, Picasso and many others, were also pioneers of this philosophy. Where the form, shapes, lines, colors, and experimental techniques become the focus of the author, simultaneously questioning the art-form and pushing it forward. Modernism entered into filmmaking during the post-war period, it’s poster-child, Michelangelo Antonioni. The Italian director was known for his atmospheric and emotional approach to filmmaking, carefully composed frames of towering modern architecture often spoke louder than the words coming out from his characters mouths. His focus? The alienation of its middle-class characters in a rapidly modernizing country, which Yang and his contemporaries also focused on.

    But unlike previous modernist movements, Taiwans new wave chose to use those methods to tell stories about civilian life. Yang was primarily characterized by his juxtaposition of modernization/capitalism and conservative and traditional Chinese ways. Similar to Antonioni, the characters desires and goals aren’t explicit as they themselves know not of what they truly want, or they are unable to express those wants and needs into words. We can see parallels to Antonioni’s 1960 drama L’Avventura, which tells a similar story of a someone gone missing while everybody else seems to lack a healthy sense of concern. Jia-li’s youthful, romantic, and idealistic visions of her relationship with De-Wei dissolve as he begins to see success in his career in the financial industry. His inescapable preoccupation with his work mirrors that of several of the other men in the film, primarily Jia-Li’s brother and father, and De-Wei’s playboy childhood friend and now boss. Contrasted by the female characters of the film which are relegated to the traditional supporting roles whether it be housewife or mistresses. As Jia-Li spends her days at a Japanese flower arrangement class, De-Wei begins to morph into his finance-bro colleagues and get involved with a fellow businesswoman. At one point Jia-Li in a moment of desperation and despair asks De-Wei…

    >__“The whole society seems designed to tear husband and wife apart. Men have their male places to go, and women have a world of their own. Sunday is the only time left to be together, but you said Sunday is your basketball day. So... what day does that leave for us? I know people who say our problem is we don’t have any kids yet. I disagree. If we can’t convince even ourselves that life is really about being happy and content, then really... how can we ever bring a child into the world? “Come with me, I’ll bring you happiness”, that would be irresponsible. Don’t you agree? These days I’ve been sleeping heavily and while I was sleeping I couldn’t stop seeing all these years as a just a long dream and our marriage was yesterday... just before the dream. We can forget dreams. Don’t we? Can’t we?”__

    Jia-Li got to choose her husband, unlike her brother who was forced into an arranged marriage, yet her fairytale has come to a dead-end. Is it the western and American influence that led her to follow her heart? Is it not the beginning signs of female liberation and autonomy, choice? In her case it was just and illusion, just because you make the “right” choice in the moment it doesn’t guarantee your future happiness. Ultimately it makes no difference as the direction of her life is still attached to and determined by men.

    By the end of the film Jai-Li’s brother Jia-Sen is on his death bed, his last moments are spent ruminating on his existence and to question whether he was ever really happy. In love with Tan in his youth but forced to marry another and follow his fathers footsteps as a physician, his life didn’t turn out to be what he and others expected. Perhaps my favorite scene is when Jia-Li Pays returns home to see her brother and they revisit the night Jia-Sen encouraged her to run away and follow her heart. Now older, wiser, and much more aware, he explains that his true wish was for her to grow up and be able to handle the difficulties of life on her own. It’s not that we should strive for this storybook happiness in life, but be able to continue living and moving forward despite the heartbreak, mistakes, and unmet expectations as reality tends to force us to be… well, realistic.

    Tan stands as the contrast to Jia-Li, in university she seemed to have the perfect life. Beautiful, talented, intelligent, and seemed to have the picture perfect relationship. It was going so well until the day the fateful day. Tans success allowed her to become the one in control, she answers only to her desires. At the start of the film we see her making the calls as she prepares for her performance, people respect her, she decides how many performances she’ll do, she decides whether or not she’ll even attend an afterparty being thrown for her. And this resilience is echoed in Tan as even though she may never find the love that she had with Jia-Sen again, she continues to live passionately through her work. Perhaps the tears that Tan sheds as the born-again business woman of Jia-Li walks away is not only for the death of her past lover, but equally for seeing her friend discover strength that she didn’t even know she herself possessed. She didn’t run away all those years ago to Europe for nothing, her worldwide success is a testament to the immense love she had for her late lover.

    At a runtime of 2 hours and 46 minutes, it can feel like it’s heading nowhere. But as with difficult films that leave you with more questions than answers, it becomes necessary to do research behind the country and the directors vision to fill in those gaps. Like many cinematic New-Wave movements across the globe, it began as a response to the lack of experimentation in the industry. Frustrated with formulaic and cookie cutter films being churned out by the big Hollywood type studios, the form fell on the shoulders of young and independent filmmakers to evolve the artform. That Day on the Beach is the 4th film I’ve seen from Yang, having watched his later works like *A Brighter Summer Day* & *Yi Yi* first. It’s an interesting journey seeing the auteurs evolution in reverse, seeing how things became tightened and much more precise in his later works versus his first entry which feels more like watching a fragmented dream. Nevertheless his vision, message, inquiries about identity in middle-class Taiwan were laid out from the get-go and continued in all his works.

    In essece *That Day, on the Beach is an optimistic film. Optimistic about how much the human spirit can endure. On how we should strive to become resilient not happy, to become reliant on ourselves, and most importantly to enjoy the little things.
