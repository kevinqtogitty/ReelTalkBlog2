  OH Jean-Luc Godard, the man, the myth, the legend. The guy whose name you throw around when you want everybody to know that you INTO films. It’s a name that’s synonymous with the French New Wave, I’d even go as far to say that both the name and the movement are interchangeable. His films broke every single rule of filmmaking. They were playful. They were meta. They were FILMS. Godard made films because it was fun to break conventions, it’s fun to experiment with the boundaries of an artform.

          Lately the thought experiment of our lives being a simulation has been on my mind, and I couldn’t stop thinking about it after watching _Vivre Sa Vie_. Divided into several chapters it follows Nana, played by the iconic Anna Karina, a mother who leaves her husband and child to chase after her dreams of becoming an actress. Running out of money she becomes a prostitute to pay her bills, but begins to succumb to the lifestyle.

          “How does this film remind you of a simulation!?” you may ask. Well, isn’t film an imaginary story that happens to just have familiar and relatable places, characters, and themes? It’s a crew of people creating this story that happens to be viewed and experienced by people all over the world over and over again. So then a simulation, similarly,  would have to be built by a single or group of people — well who knows if it’s a person right? The idea is at least in film we are aware that the characters don’t actually exist, they are only representatives of what could be real. But for us each individual is aware of their existence, but who are our creators?

          You can replay a film over and over again, the story remains the same everytime. It marches at the same pace, it has the same plot, it has the same faces. Then what if our lives end and we’re destined to live it all over again?

          So back to _Vivre Sa Vie_, the reason it reminded me of such a thought experiment was because there is a very thin veil of a plot. Like reality we plan our lives in years or days but inbetween each checkpoint is the mundane and routine actions of our “unique” lives. Godard happens to let us in on the tragic life of a women who dreams of stardom but instead falls too deep into the lifestyle of a prostitute. It’s a reminder that not all films have happy endings, nor do the endings have to be built on any reason, because our lives operate on just as much randomness. If the characters in the film have no control of what happens to them, well then really neither do we. Yes, we have the ability to forge our own futures and pursue our dreams like Nana but ultimately not everyone gets the same opportunities, and not everyone makes it.

          _Vivre Sa Vie_ is the alternate story of Anna Karina’s life. Having left Denmark at the age of 17 to pursue acting in Paris. She started with a successful modelling career before Godard spotted her on the streets of Paris. And the rest is history. Here’s another thought experiment, there’s probably a parallel universe in which _Vivre Sa Vie_ is her reality, and her success story was turned into a film. Obviously you could say all these things about any other film, I think New Wave films happens to stick out when thinking about such things is due to the movements purpose of breaking the mold and rules and expanding that boundaries of what kind, and how, stories are told.
