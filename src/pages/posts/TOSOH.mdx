Aki Kaurasmaki’s _On the Other Side of Hope_ brings into question the western worlds response to refugees seeking asylum in their countries during the events of the Arab Spring. It asks, are we doing enough? Enough to give them work opportunities so they one day be reunited with their families? Are we doing enough to protect them against those who see there presence as a target for there irrational hatred? And do we even try, at the very least, to make them feel welcome in their new home?

          The film follows Khalid (Sherwan Haji), a Syrian refugee who’s been separated from his sister and has been on the run and searching for her ever since. Forced to sneak aboard a cargo ship to escape, he is told by a friendly ship worker of the greatness of Finland, arriving only to be let down by its cold bureaucracy and persecuted by Alt-Right skinheads. We also follow, Wikstrom (Sakari Kuosmanen), a retired salesman turned restaurateur, who becomes Khalid’s last chance and only hope at surviving long enough to be reunited with his sister. _On the Other Side of Hope_ doesn’t attempt to take a typical film moral high ground, instead opting the Kaurasmaski staples of wry humor, laconic dialogue, beautiful theater like sets and props, all wrapped up into a story about the necessary kindness we must exact if we wish to live peacefully in a rapidly globalizing world. As Kaurasmaki said in a panel the 2017 Berlin Film Festival…

“We are all the same, we are all human and tomorrow it will be you who will be a refugee”
The film opens with Khalid emerging from under a pile of coals, his face covered in soot as if he were at war. Making his way off the docks in the dark early hours of the day, he almost gets hit by Wikstrom on his way to his work. The two exchange blank looks, emphasizing the invisibility of refugees and their problems in new countries. He eventually turns himself in to immigration authority and befriends an Iraqi refugee Mazdak (Simon Hussein) along with several others awaiting to be granted asylum. Meanwhile Wikstrom decides to cash in his business, entering into a high stakes poker game where he puts it all on the line and wins big. The following day he heads to an agency and purchases a local restaurant. There he meets his quirky team consisting of a doorman, waitress, and by far my favorite, the head chef. Whose creativity hilariously only extends to how many different ways he can serve pickled herring. Khalid soon sits before court, denied asylum and scared to return to the war torn home town of Aleppo, escapes the immigration center with the help of one of its staff members. Hiding from authorities behind Wikstroms dumpsters the two meet again, desperate to not get kicked out of his hiding place the two duke it out this time exchanging a single punch instead of mere glances.

          Behind Wikstroms stoic exterior lies a true man of the service industry, taking in Khalid to his restaurant after their brawl to offer him both a job and a place to live.  For those who’ve worked in food and hospitality, it’s well known to us that the industry is built upon the backs and hard work of immigrants. Tucked away from the sight of it’s clientele are kitchens that don’t speak a lick of English, that cook our not just their cuisines but the cuisines of other cultures. This is hilariously displayed in Wikstroms attempt to expand its clientele by making it more hip, hip in this case being, sushi. The recurring motif of ethnic restaurants poorly reproducing authentic cuisine is shown later with an Indian restaurant as well, in which they misspell Gandhi as Gandi. Repackaged for a western palette, or at least with approachable flavors, ethnic cuisine in a foreign country isn’t really concerned with serving authentic food but rather to provide an exotic experience that watered down just enough to get people in the door. It’s a take on how the western world is so absorbed in and of itself, proclaiming to be a melting pot or advertising its multiculturalism in an effort to make themselves seem more progressive than they actually are. After a disastrous dinner service for Japanese tourists, in which the team serves pickled herring sushi with giant globs of wasabi, Wikstroms restaurant goes back to serving what it does best, boiled potatoes and pickled herring.


          In exchange for his help, Wikstrom gets Khalid a fake Finnish ID through the help of his doorman’s “hacker-man” nephew. Allowing him to walk the streets and freeing him from the persecution’s of the government, but not from far right wing thugs. A horrifying scene of Khalid being attacked, beaten to the floor, as one of the men begin to spray him in lighter fluid, forces us to see and empathize with the terrible things immigrants must deal with. Saved at the last moment by a couple of strangers Khalid escapes to live another day, how much more will he have to face before he is finally reunited with his sister, and is this a place he even wants to bring her too?


          Through the help of Mazdak and his friends and family back in Iraq, they locate Khalids sister, Miriam. And through Wikstroms connections they find a man working on the ports of Helsinki who can get her to safety, and back into the arms of her brother. Narrowly escaping port authority, the two reunite and share a lovely night together at a restaurant recounting their memories of each other as children, and Miriams future. Meanwhile, late that same night Wikstrom finds his wife working at a food kiosk, the hours have kept her far and away from drinking. Happy to see her doing better, the two seem to have found a bit of peace in their rocky relationship.

          After dinner Khalid drops his sister off at his coworkers house and makes his way home to the storage closet. Just as Khalid reaches his door he gets stabbed by one of the anti-migrant thugs from earlier. Left to bleed to death, Khalid manages to bandage himself up. The next day he meets Miriam outside the immigration office to give her some advice, giving her one last hug as they part. Khalid makes it to a field by the water, resting against a tree, finding peace with the puffs of a cigarette and the company of a puppy. His goal, accomplished.


          _The Other Side of Hope_ is part of Kaurasmakis “Port Trilogy,” stories involving the docks as an essential piece of his films. Perhaps his most political film to date, it manages to not feel so in-your-face about it. His roundabout way of discussing the refugee crisis allows us to empathize with Khalid and his struggle while still enjoying the deadpan humor and other hallmarks of a Kuarasmaki film. It end ambiguously for Khalid, does he stay alive to be with his sister or does he die under the tree before he even finishes his therapeutic cigarette? In the end it doesn’t matter, he’s finally been able to stop moving, no need to run from border to border, no more worrying about his sister, and no longer afraid that he might get deported. Both Wikstrom and Khalid have found peace in their respective worlds. With his signature drollery and incredible noir like lighting, Kurasmaki makes for a film as visually unique as his approach to such a large issue facing the western and Arab world.
