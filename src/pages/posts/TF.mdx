Look, I’ll be honest. I’m torn over Lena Dunham, on the one hand, as a minority, Girls was a hilarious and intelligent critique of privileged and lost twenty-something white girls living in Brooklyn. On the other hand that means a lot of what Dunham puts out is partially unrelatable to people outside that demographic. That being said Lena Dunham had emerged as a unique voice, speaking to a generation of disoriented post-grads — a delicate balancing act of millennial quirkiness and complete self-awareness. Delving into familial relationships, post-grad angst, and less than thrilling relationships, _Tiny Furniture_ allows us to feel not so alone in an awkward time many of us go through. It’s a film that says, “It’s gonna be alright, you’ll figure it out."

           Having just graduated with a film degree and recently dumped by her college boyfriend Aura (Dunham) moves back in with her mother and sister as she struggles to figure out what to do with her life. Shortly after coming home to TriBeca she attends a party and becomes infatuated with an up-and-coming youtuber/filmmaker. At the same party she reconnects with her childhood friend and recovering drug addict Charlotte. Feeling overshadowed by the academic success of her teenage sister and the established photographic career of her mother, the film unfolds aimlessly and wanders about similarly to our main protagonist.


           In an odd act to win Jed over she invites him to stay with her while her mother and sister head out on a week-long college tour. Meanwhile she gets a rather sad job as a day hostess answering phones, there a flirtatious friendship begins when one of the chefs learns that she can get him pills.

          “Well what happens after that?” You might ask. Honestly there’s not much else to be explained. There’s regrettable sex in a construction pipe, weed smoking, and some broken relationships. Really, _Tiny Furniture_ is an examination of that odd limbo period in your life where you’ve finally gotten that degree only to come to the realization that you’re not even close to being the kind of adult you’d imagine yourself to be. Walking around in your underwear munching on snacks around your moms house, stick and poke tattoos, attending parties of people you don’t really fuck with while trying to socialize, and the god awful truth of shitty restaurant jobs. All while trying to find some decent romance.

          Instead of embellished lines delivered with grand emotions Dunham gives us quiet and controlled moments of frustration. Characters feel real partly because they’re played by real life friends and family. With simple camerawork, wide and still composed frames, Dunham allows the characters have natural conversations in both large and small spaces. It’s a great (albeit slow) mumblecore piece that captures the post grad aimlessness many of us feel. Several of the actors end up reprising similar characters a few years later in the HBO produced show Girls. Dunham truly offers a unique — at times even brazen — vision and voice to a generation.
