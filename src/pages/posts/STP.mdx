Jim Jarmusch’s _Stranger than Paradise_ hit theaters in 1984 bursting open the doors for a new wave of independent filmmakers to be seen, and cementing both the film and Jarmusch as true American voices in cinema. It’s a bare bones story that examines the relationship between people and places, the absurdity of life, and all the small moments in-between. Composed of almost all master shots, with the occasional pan side to side, its minimalist approach invites you to slow down and hangout with some cool cats.

          The film revolves around the relationship between three characters as they fill their days chain smoking Chesterfield cigarettes, betting on race horses, and discuss just what exactly is in a TV dinner. Eva, a Hungarian teen, arrives in New York City on her way to live with her aunt in Cleveland, while in the city she stays with her estranged Hungarian-born but fully Americanized cousin, Willie. A too-cool-for-school New York hipster, Willie is less than enthusiastic of the arrival and reminder of his eastern European heritage.


           Interrupting his idle life, Eva starts out her stay in America as a mere nuisance, but over the ten days she is forced to stay with him their relationship begins to sweeten. As Jarmusch jumps from scene to scene of the two doing and talking about random things around the apartment, he cuts to black for a few seconds allowing us to think and anticipate what is to come next. He does this sometimes to tell us a visual joke over the course of a single day.


           Or to cut to a casual scene highlighting their contrasting cultural approaches to what is acceptable for dinner.


          Their time together eventually comes to an end as Eva leaves for Cleveland to go live with their aunt Lotte. Having gotten use to her company, Willie’s friend and sidekick Eddie suggests they hit the road and pay her a visit. During the winter months, with a car full of beer and winnings from a rigged poker game, they set out on their journey to Cleveland. On the way they pass through several changing landscapes, observing industrial plants, empty small towns, and historic architecture all covered by a blanket of snow. Painting a bleak environment bearing much resemblance to communist era Hungary. Greeted by his stout and babushka-esque aunt, Willie begins to warm up to his Hungarian roots over the course of their short visit. Trading in the Budweiser for goulash and poker for an unwinnable Hungarian card game.

          Reunited with Eva, we are treated to the quiet and familiar scenes. From staring at a kung fu movie in the theater, to a sweet quiet moment in which Eva and Willie sit around a coffee table as he tries to remember a joke. Jarmusch is here to say it doesn’t matter where you happen to be in the world or what your cultural background is, people are more less just sitting around with their friends watching TV, drinking and smoking, playing cards and having a laugh or two.


          The trio then decide to ditch the frigid snowscape of Ohio and make there way to sunny Florida. Meandering about for most of the film, the last 20 minutes gives a bit struggle for our gang culminating in a resolution, with a single scene, that proves to be both hilarious and completely out-of-left field.

          _Stranger than Paradise_ takes Jean-Luc Godards iconic Bande à part and puts it on the road, injecting it full of deadpan humor, and with a unique American sensibility. In a time when big-budget Hollywood movies ruled the cinematic landscape, Jarmusch arrived on the scene with a simple plot, shot in black and white, bearing no resemblance of the image of America sold overseas and removed from ostentatious Hollywood. Stranger than Paradise puts us into a dingy alternate American universe, filled with the usual Jarmusch hallmarks. Its a hilarious film through and through, only made better by its superb deadpan acting and it’s neorealist portrayal of America.
