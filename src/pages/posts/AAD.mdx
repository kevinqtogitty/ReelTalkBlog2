<article class="main-content">
    It’s March 8th 1945, the Nazis have just surrendered and are making their exit out of Poland. Celebrations are taking place all over Europe as the war has come to an end, and spilt blood turns into champagne and vodka. Except, this is just the beginning for Poland and their neighbors as the Soviet Union slowly makes their entrance.

    Andrzej Wajdas’ 1958 film *Ashes and Diamonds* depicts the plight of one man as he tries to change the course of his life in a single night. Dubbed affectionately as the “Polish James Dean,” Zbigniew Cybulski plays Maciek, a member of the Polish resistance, now an assassin targeting Communist leaders in Poland.

    After Maciek and his comrades kill two innocent passerbys who they mistook for as the newly appointed Polish secretary of the Communist Workers Party, they’re ordered to make a second attempt. This time it’s at a hotel in Ostrowiec where a banquet will take place to celebrate the end of the war. Their target, named Szczuka, was a fellow fighter during the war, but now their ideas about the future of Poland have divided its people.

    Maciek’s accompanied by Andrzej (Adam Pawlikowski) a proud servant of the resistance, and Drewnowski a loose drunk who’s working both sides to secure the best outcome for himself. Over the course of the night Maciek begins to question whether or not he can continue living the life of a killer.

    Andrzej stands as Macieks counterpart, he’s collected, results focused, and has accepted his fate as a dead man — an obedient servant to the cause. Whereas Macieks optimism about the future is his biggest obstacle. And this optimism only grows stronger when he meets and gets entangled with Krystyna (Ewa Krzyzewska), the barmaid. Maciek, through his charm, charisma, and persistence convinces her come to his hotel room after her shift. As the two lie naked in bed together they begin to talk about whether they could actually work. They come to a somber agreement that their lives were only meant to cross on this one night.

    Krystyna in this case comes to resemble hope, hope for the future of Poland, and for Maciek a hope that he can start a brand new life. Feeling blue they decide to take a walk, but as rain begins to come down they run into a nearby ruined church.

    Krystyna notices some inscriptions on the wall and begins to read it, it turns out to be a piece by the late Polish poet Cyprian Norwid aptly titled *Ashes and Diamonds*. Maciek recites it from memory with as sad tone when Krystyna reaches an illegible part.

    >*“So often, are you as a blazing torch with flames
    of burning rags falling about you flaming,
    you know not if flames bring freedom or death.
    Consuming all that you must cherish
    if ashes only will be left, and want Chaos and tempest
    Or will the ashes hold the glory of a starlike diamond
    The Morning Star of everlasting triumph.”*

    As Krystyna walks around in the rubble, one of her heels snaps. Maciek being the go-getter that he is, runs into the next room looking for something to fix it. Unbeknownst to him the room that he has just entered is where two men lay dead under the covers. He realizes as he lifts up the cover that it’s the two innocent men he murdered. The scene signifying that Maciek cannot escape the sins he’s committed no matter where he goes.

    The lovers return to the hotel and say their final goodbyes, and he promises to try to change things so that they can be together. Maciek then meets up with Andrzej to discuss their plan of action. After his evening with Krystyna, and getting a taste of how different his life could be, he unloads his feelings in front of Andrzej. Unsympathetic to Macieks personal dilemma he reminds him that joining the resistance meant sacrificing your personal life for the greater cause. Maciek decides to carry out the assassination, but it will be his last.

    Meanwhile the whole evening Drewnoski has been drunkenly schmoozing with party officials looking to secure a job in postwar Poland. Eventually making a fool of himself in front of all the attendees. In the end he is thrown out of the banquet he organized himself, and his chances of finding work in politics are flushed down the drain.

    Maciek follows Szczuka onto the streets and shoots him, his victim takes his final steps towards Maciek. And as Szczuka holds onto Maciek the fireworks explode high above in the sky in one of the most iconic scenes in cinema. The embrace could be read as although Szczuka was hugging his son, assuring that both ideals of the future of Poland would be far better than what is had gone through during the war.

    As the sun rises Maciek returns to the hotel to see Krystyna one last time before he leaves town, but breaks the news to her that he was unable to change the situation leaving her heartbroken. He’s realized that he can’t live a life with Krystyna with the things he’s done.

    As he leaves and makes his way to the train station he sees Andrzej beat Drewnoski for his renewed loyalty to the resistance after his embarrassing display the night before. Drewnoski spots Maciek from afar as Andrzej leaves him. Maciek flees and accidentally bumps into the Polish Peoples Army around the corner and draws his pistol out instinctively and tries to run away but is wounded by the bullets of the soldiers. He manages to escape the them, running into a garbage field where he takes his final breaths and dies.

    Made during the Soviet Union era, Wajda had to make sure that there was no explicit bias or favor for the West due to censorship. Inspired by Italian Neorealism, incorporating French New Wave techniques, and using noir lighting Wajda creates a dynamic and complex story of post-war Poland. It has cemented itself into world cinema history and is the unofficial film of Poland.
