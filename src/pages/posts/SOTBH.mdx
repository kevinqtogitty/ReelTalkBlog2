<article class="main-content">
    Frankensteins creation. Perhaps the first story of a monster that humanity can empathize with. Forced into existence from his creator and misunderstood by the world he is now a part of, forever an outcast. In Victor Erices’ *The Spirit of the Beehive* the monsters childlike sensibilities, yet freakish features seems to mesmerize a crowd of rural workers and their children in the townhall one evening in the quiet Castillian countryside. Amongst the crowd are sisters Isabel and Ana, the latter completely engulfed by the film and with the creatures wholesome interaction with a girl her age by the river. The film immediately cuts from the river scene directly to where the father carries the little girls drowned body through the street. Confused by why he would do such a thing, and why the villagers would decide to kill him, Ana asks her sister later that night. Isabels response falls short of Ana’s expectation as she tells her that everything in the film is fake. But to get Ana to bed she tells her that the spirit of Frankensteins monster lives in an abandoned stable nearby. Soon they make frequent visits to the place in hopes of finding the spirit until one day a mysterious visitor takes refuge in the stable.

    *The Spirit of the Beehive* takes the childlike wonder and curiosity and uses it to explore rural life around the time of the Spanish Civil War. It’s a historical drama with elements of horror set circa 1940 somewhere in the hills of the Castilian countryside soon after the Nationalists overthrew the democratically elected Republic. It follows a loosely-knit family as each one navigates their own solitary world. A meditation on the fractured Spanish society, isolation, maturity, combined with Luis Caudrados’ dream-like cinematography, and incredibly quiet yet powerful performances make for an unforgettable film.

    Here are 5 things that make *The Spirit of the Beehive* a giant in world cinema.

    # 1. World of children

        * Victor Erice tells his story through the world of children. Immersed in their youthful sensibilities and games, we are reminded that even though adults and children occupy the same physical world, how we interpret things is very very different. This seperation is reflected in several moments of the film which include the scene in which Ana believes shes encountered the the spirit of Frankensteins monster in the abandoned farmhouse, when actually this person turns out to be a wounded soldier of the republic. Her naivete towards the situation around her mirrors that of Frankensteins and his experience towards his new reality.

    # 2. Loss of innocence

       * As the film follows two sisters both of whom are still children, the small age difference between them in large and speaks volumes in how as we age we begin to learn more and more about the realities of the world. This difference can be seen in the way Ana looks to her older sister for answers. Meanwhile Isabel begins to explore her femininity with lipstick, lying to her sister, and even playing slightly sadistic games. It’s in part a painful reminder that growing up is hard, and at every stage of life comes with new highs and lows.

    # 3. Allegory for the Spanish Civil War

       * It can be said that the whole film is one giant symbol for life under the Francoist regime. Fernandos writing on the monotony, habitual, and meaningless existence of  the life of bees can be interpreted as views on life under Franco. Society enslaved by a force they cannot overcome, for the bees it’s their natural instinct and for the people it’s the governments which hold absolute power.

    # 4. Natural light

        * Shot by Luis Cuadrado, the film is an hour and 37 minute painting. Massive shadows of clouds sweeping over the barren hills of the Castilian countryside, rooms drowned in rich golden light (Vermeer is the the first to come to mind) and carefully composed shots feel like they’ve been pulled straight out of an art gallery.

    # 5. The power of restraint

        * What might drive many people to dislike this film might also be the reason why people are drawn to it. It’s sparse in dialogue and heavy in atmosphere and mood. The characters seem to only speak in the most dire of situations. Adults hardly exchanging words with each other, opting instead to muse about things and remember better days with their inner dialogue. Like many Spanish creatives and artists at the time, you could say the final piece is a product of censorship. Having to find ways to express views and ideas through unconventional or subversive methods and techniques.

        *The Spirit of the Beehive* is a film which rewards it’s audience with multiple viewings, and challenges us to think about how cinema can speak for a whole generation. It’s a multilayered piece that reminds us about our imaginative youths which shielded us from the realities of a cold world.

    ** Some background on Spain. It’s 1940 and the Nationalists backed by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy have just overthrown the democratically elected Republic of Spain. The history of the country leading up to the war is incredibly complex but whats important to know was that Alfonso XIII held democratic elections in 1931 which would allow his people to decide the future government of Spain. The result? To end the Spanish Monarchy and replace it with a left-wing liberal Republic. The wealthy landowners, clergy, and traditionalists opposed the socialist reforms that were taking place all across Spain. In short the fear of a marxist government gave way for Francisco Franco, other Spanish military leaders, and monarchal loyalist groups to unite and stage a coup in 1936 for control of Spain, it would set the stage for the official start of the Spanish Civil War the same year lasting until April 1939. Spain would live under Franco and his fascist regime until his death in 1975.
