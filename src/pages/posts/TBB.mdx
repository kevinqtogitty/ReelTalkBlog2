     Everybody’s favorite deep-set eyed, casual heroin addict looking artist makes an abstract nearly plotless road film about human connection. Oh and he has his ex girlfriend, the iconic queen of the small screen Chloe Sevigny blow him on camera. If this description doesn’t make you jump out of your seat at half mast screaming “where the fuck can I watch this movie?” Well, first off you’re probably not a perv which is good. But it’s probably best cause it sure as hell ain’t for everybody.

    Divisive to say the least, It premiered at Cannes in 2004 where it was met with much negativity. Even the theatrical cut I cannot recommend to many people. It’s experimental, slow, meditative, full of vague quiet dialogue, or as others would say… boring.

    The film stars Vincent Gallo as our main guy, Bud Clay, a professional motorcycle racer who’s on a post-competition road trip from New Hampshire to Los Angeles. Along the way, on separate occasions, he meets 3 women, eventually and abruptly ending their encounters. Desperately yearning for a feminine connection he seems to have lost, Bud tries to replicate intimate moments of a relationship with random women. In one scene he stops at a rest stop and sees a woman sitting alone, the camera lingers on the both of them subtly acknowledging each others lonely presence. Bud walks past to grab a cola from the vending machine, passing her on his way back to the car, he turns around halfway and sits down beside her. She moves her which has her name monogrammed on it, Lilly. She seems hurt. He’s hurt. Bud begins to caress her face, she accepts it. She needs it. They kiss and press cheek to cheek. Confused but emotionally charged Lilly doesn’t say a word. A few minutes go by and Bud has had his fill, he gets up and drives away. Lilly sits alone again.

    Ultimately realizing that what he’s lost, he’s lost forever.w In this case is his lover Daisy, played by Chloe Sevigny. He arrives in LA and pulls into the driveway of an empty suburban home, calling for Daisy. She’s not there. He leaves a note. Bud then checks into a hotel and informs the front desk that he’s expecting a guest to call or show up, Daisy. Low and behold she magically appears out of thin air in his hotel room. Almost bummed at her presence, Bud sits on the side of the bed with his hunched back towards the camera as Daisy tries to comfort him. To deal with Buds indifference and silence she excuses herself to the bathroom to smoke crack. She’s soon sitting on Buds lap, it looks like they’re going to make up. The hotel room all of a sudden looks very artificially lit, as if it were a stage. The two start kissing and caressing each other. Daisy gets on her knees and presses her face into his pelvis.

    What follows is 3-4 minutes of dedicated actress Chloe Sevigny sucking dick on camera while Gallo whispers sour things at her. It’s clear that Bud can’t resolve his feelings for his drug addicted girlfriend. Emptied he immediately breaks down into tears. It’s revealed through flashbacks that they were at a party one night. Daisy who was pregnant at the time, befriended some guys at the party and smoked marijuana with them. Drunk and high Daisy passes out in a bedroom and is raped by some of the men of whom she had met earlier. Bud witnesses the event through the slightly open door, completely shocked he leaves the party and eventually comes back to see Daisy in a body bag on a stretcher. Daisy reveals that she choked on her own vomit and died while he was away. Bud is gripped by his overwhelming sense of guilt and inaction. He wakes up the next morning alone. Daisy was merely a dream.

    What I admire about Gallo is that in all his hipster narcissist ways, there’s a clear message in his films. Is it low budget or does he respect his audience and believe that they’re emotionally intelligent enough to understand? Somewhere between the two lies the genius of *The Brown Bunny* as he explores loss, loneliness, eternal guilt, all wrapped up in the American open road goodness. Not recommended for the masses, but for those who value vision and meaning over the standard criteria of what constitutes a “good” film. You will be rewarded with an emotionally complex and puzzling journey for closure.
