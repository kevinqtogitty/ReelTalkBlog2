 **Note**: I have not read Thomas Mann’s novel of which the film is adapted from. Thoughts and opinions are based purely on the film alone.

          Adapted from Thomas Mann’s Novella comes Viscontis adaptation of *Death In Venice*. A tale of a composer whose creative and artistic abilities have become sterile. With his career stunted and his health in decline Gustav von Aschenbach (Dirk Bogarde) travels to Venice for a vacation meant to reinvigorate his creativity. There alone at the lavish Hotel on the Lido his eyes wander across the opulent rooms examining the many wealthy families he’s surrounded by. His wandering gaze eventually meets with a teenage boy Tadzio, stricken by the young polish boys beauty and youth Aschenbach seems to have found the source of inspiration he’s been after.

          This film walks a fine line between aesthetic appreciation and a perverse longing for a minor. Obviously this film has been lauded for a reason, and definitely not for one that is sickening. I’ve heard through many sources that Thomas Mann’s version walks more evidently on the side of finding beauty that moves the soul, and that the film because of its visual nature doesn’t make that very clear; a common conflict translating a story from one medium to the other. That said, the film walks on the fine line because of the astounding cinematography and reproduction of early 20th century Venice.

           The camera wanders and searches much like our protagonist, slow moving and artistically appreciative of enters its field of view. Going into *Death In Venice* without any prior knowledge of its source material and ideas made it feel very slow at the beginning, with very little dialogue it can leave the audience lost and bored until the introduction of Tadzio. It’s not until his entrance that we understand the visual approach. Tadzio is in fact, at least to Aschenbach, a walking renaissance painting. They often cross paths at the hotel and on the beach, Tadzio lingers around Aschebach for a few moments holding eye contact, never uttering a word and leaves him almost always with a feeling of crippling inferiority and desire. The kind of desire is never made clear to us, but there is a clear contrast between Aschenbachs aging and disconnection to his art, and Tadzios youthful freedom and his beauty.

          One could make a sort of argument that this is in fact a tale of homosexual desire, after all Bogarde was known for playing LGBTQ roles during his career. Although he never admitted to be homosexual during his lifetime, due to the fact that it would’ve led to the end of his career and reputation, his roles can only allow us to infer Visconti’s spin on *Death In Venice*. As for the pedophilia many might see, that inference would be a massive disservice to Thomas Mann’s intention. *Death In Venice* is a universal story of people wanting what they used to have, in this case to be young and free again able to discover art and the world anew. That goes for people who scout for rising athletes and academics, it goes for all artists who no longer see the art they’ve dedicated their lives to with fresh eyes and ears.

While on vacation signs of an outbreak of cholera begin to show up, sanitation of the city and empty streets signal Aschenbach that something is going on. Except no one in town will tell him or any of the other tourists of what is really happening. Stuck in the city and unable to get back home to his wife in Germany Aschenbach catches the illness and spend his final hours on the beach. As his hair dye and makeup dribbles down his face revealing his wrinkling skin, he catches one last glimpse of Tadzio blurrily walking into the shimmering ocean.

Visconti gives us a beautiful cinematic ride, moving paintings of the wealthy on vacation, adorned in expensive jewels and elaborate costumes. Capturing a sense of longing for the things we see in other that we have lost. Barring comparison to the book itself, _Death In Venice_ is one long glorious moving painting. But the age disparity between the two main characters proves to be an odd detail that takes us out of the visual enjoyment.
