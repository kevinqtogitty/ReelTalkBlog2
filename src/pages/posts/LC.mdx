    Lucrecia Martels debut feature La Cienaga follows an extended provincial Argentinian family as they battle with a thick and sweaty summer. It’s a place where the wine flows non-stop and the ever-present possibility of torrential downpour looms high above the mountains. Detached from religion, morality, and nature, we watch the family begin to succumb to the overwhelming undercurrent of malaise coating there summer.

    The film opens with the sound of metal chairs being lazily dragged poolside, the sound of ice rattling in the wineglass, of a gun being fired and thunder striking far in the distance, and the constant buzzing of cicadas. Martel isn’t here just to tell a story, but to completely immerse us in this strange summer vacation by fully engaging our senses. Not concerned with the details, La Cienaga plays like a broken memory, where the atmosphere of the moments are more important than telling a traditional story.

    The film revolves around two related families. Mechas, a 24/7 drunk, is obsessed with the idea of a planned trip to Bolivia to escape the bog after she has a drunken accident. Her family consists of her husband, Gregorio, who’s only concern is his graying hair. Her daughter Momi perpetually wearing the same blue plaid swimsuit gazes at her maid Isabel with vague signs of attraction. While her other daughter Vero and her son Joses’ relationship blurs the line between sibling playfulness and suggestions of incest. While Talis (the other matriarch/cousin of Mechas) family includes her young daughters who seem to have discovered there sexuality much too early; her son who constantly injures himself; and a couple of other prepubescent boys who run around in the jungle with loaded rifles talking as if they were 50 year-old classist/ignorant men.

    With so many points of view to tell a single story from, Martel chooses to leverage this to her advantage. We’re not allowed to get close enough to understand the motives and real intentions of the characters. The distance and ambiguity in conjunction with the constant and out of place sounds of the countryside create an atmosphere similar to that of a horror film. This is where Martel shines as a contemporary master of the film form, her focus on soundscape comes before the narrative. This allows her to create a unique interplay between sight and sound.

    La Cienaga is part a reconstruction of Martels childhood memories spent in Salta and part portrait of a morally degrading bourgeois Argentine society. It is by no means an easy film to watch, and that’s something Martel has acknowledged in several interviews. It’s a film that challenges the viewer at every corner. Not a single second does one feel like they are certain of what is going on, that feeling of uneasiness sits from beginning till end. La Cienaga asks us to forget the traditional narrative structure, and instead asks for use our senses to guide us through her vision.
