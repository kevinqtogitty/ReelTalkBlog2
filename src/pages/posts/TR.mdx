# Summary

Jean Renoirs’ The River was his first color film, exploding onto the screen with intensely saturated frames and expertly composed visuals evocative of impressionist paintings. The story moves gently and steadily, mirroring the flow of the Ganges river; of which film is set upon. Through western eyes eastern philosophies of birth, youth, innocence lost, life, death, and the cyclical nature of it all are packaged and presented with a familiar coming of age story.

          The film revolves around the life of an English family living in a large estate in the Indian countryside, nestled along the banks of the Ganges river and surrounded by the working class locals. Their leisurely life is shaken up by the arrival of a charming and sophisticated American war veteran; immediately becoming the object of their affection. And through their courtships they learn that growing up isn’t as glamorous as the stories they’ve been told.

# Thoughts and Observations

It’s hard not to see the impact that Renoirs father had on his film-making, especially in The River. It’s A peak inside upper class provincial life in a not so typical impressionist setting. It’s quiet and unhurried, not slow by any means, but paced in such a way that the grand themes of time and rebirth don’t feel like they’re weighing down the film. The visuals alone are worth revisiting the film for years to come, carefully composed, layers upon layers, and every frame using it’s foreground, middleground, and background to the fullest . Take a still from this film and stick it on a wall next to a Manet and it’d blend right in.

          Filmed on location near the capital of Calcutta, Renoir paints India, its people and culture with a respectful poetic brush. The central theme being rebirth and time is visited over and over again with major events and scenes occurring in and around it the river. Just like the cycle of samsara, the river flows endlessly. Livelihoods depending on in it, bygone civilizations birthed by it, continually flowing through times of war and prosperity. It makes no distinction between individuals, communities, or societies. To it, our lives are one and the same. We flow into existence and out from it, one life to the next.


          A particularly memorable scene in the film is when Harriet attempts to win over Captain Jack by telling him a love story; wherein two fated lovers are touched by the Hindu god and goddess Krishna and Radha. The story of two gods are then shown to us through the choreography and movements of a dance sequence performed by the goddess and consort of Krishna, Radha. The characters in which Harriet describes are portrayed by Melanie and Anil (childhood friend from the upper noble class). An ancient eastern love story narrated by a western girl, about divine intervention that transcends time and culture, destined to repeat itself for eternity. At the end of the story the bride enters the river with her mother. A ritual in which they pray for the blessing of a child, something her mother did soon after she was married, thus continuing the cycle.

# Conclusion

The relaxed, slow and still movements of the camera; with the use of fades between shots matches the pace of a humanistic and meditative narrative. The colors brought out by Technicolor are greatly enhanced by Indias natural vibrancy, and make for visually stunning experience.

          I would’ve liked to see Melanie and Capt. Johns storyline delved into a little deeper. There is so much to unearth there about the feelings of returning to a homeland only to find yourself divorced from the people and it’s culture you once where a part of.

          Enjoy the film for what it is, and don’t judge it for what it is not.
