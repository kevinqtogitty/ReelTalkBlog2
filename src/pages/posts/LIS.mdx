It’s 1990 and Margaret Thatcher steps down as Prime Minister. Dubbed by the Russian media as the “Iron Lady,” under Thatcher the United Kingdom was pulled out of it’s darkest days during the 70’s. A controversial political figure, Thatcher was both worshiped and vilified for her radical policies that repealed and cut spending towards social services and pushed England into a privatized and capitalist playing field. Of course there’s much more to that story, but perhaps a better way to understand the populous’ views towards Thatcherism is to watch a Mike Leigh film. As a rising filmmaker Mike Leigh produced several television films and plays revolving around British life during the years of Thatcher.

          Leigh and several other directors were highly critical of where Britain was headed under the conservative party, and it was during these massive sweeping changes that birthed a cinematic renaissance in the country. Over the 80’s-90’s his films covered English citizens of every class. _Life is Sweet_ is a step in the other direction, instead of harshly critical it’s joyfully optimistic.

          The film is centered around a warm-hearted lower-middle class family living in the northern suburbs of London. Headed by Andy (Jim Broadbent), a senior chef who buys a rusty trailer with hopes of turning it into a mobile fast food stand, and his chipper and skeptical wife Wendy (Alison Steadman). Their twin daughters couldn’t be anymore different; Natalie (Claire Skinner) with her tomboyish nature works as a plumber, while her sister Nicola (Jane Horrocks) is a shut-in and  a loud foul mouthed anti-capitalist who seems to only wear overalls over a shirt that reads “Bollocks to the Poll Tax!.”

The film focuses heavily on the struggling relationship between people and food. Nicola, suffering from bulimia, spends her nights shoving junk food down her throat only to immediately forcing herself to vomit into a plastic bag. Her self-destructive relationship with food also extends to her love life where she has to have the boy shes seeing tie her to the bed and smear chocolate all over her body in order to be satisfied. Her casual and emotionless relationship with him eventually leads him to leave her. In a moment of frustration and overwhelming love for her daughter, Wendy reveals to her Nicola that she was in the hospital with only a few days left to live because of her condition. That although Nicola feels like the odd one out, her family has never left her side and only wants to see her happy.

          Meanwhile a family friend, socially awkward Aubrey (Timothy Spall), opens a tacky french restaurant named The Regret Rien with plans to serve guests his quirky vision of haute cuisine. Spoiler. It fails miserably. Andy purchases the trailer but never gets around to actually fixing it up, preferring to spend his nights getting drunk at the pubs. Natalie is by far the most relaxed one, saving up for a trip to the USA she spends her free time hanging out at the pub and playing pool with her mates.

          In a commentary for the film, Mike Leigh lists all the things _Life is Sweet_ is about. A to Z everything from alcholism and affection to the USA and family. _Life is Sweet_ doesn’t settle into a a few or even a single subject or theme, instead Leigh pulls out all the stops which creates the realism that he’s known for. Obviously the film is centered around the family and their unconditional love for each other despite each of their flaws and quirks. Each character brings their dreams and fears into the mix, sometimes its simmering and sometimes its explosive. In the end the family gathers round in the living room, sharing a break and having a cup of tea. It’s the little moments spent with the people you love that make life that much sweeter.
