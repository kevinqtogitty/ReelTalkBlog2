# Summary

          Abbas Kiarostamis’ 2010 art-house film drops us in on a daytrip between antiques dealer Elle (Binoche) and writer/art critic James Miller (Shimell). After attending a lecture Miller is giving on his new book, Elle offers to take him around town and help him shop for art. The two spend their day together strolling around a small picturesque Tuscan village while discussing matters revolving around parenthood, relationships, and each others  romantic desires.

          Their day is spent hopping from one establishment to the next while passing by newlyweds and ageing couples. But as the day goes on, the course of their relationship takes a turn for the strange as the conversations become increasingly difficult and confusing. In some scenes they begin to unload all their disappointments about each other as absent parents and lovers, while in others they act like complete strangers. And as the film goes on it becomes unclear what the true nature of their relationship is.

          Are they a couple role playing as a strangers to rekindle a strained marriage? Is Elle a long-time mistress of James? Are we the viewer being plucked from one timeline (scene to scene) to another, seeing one version of them as strangers getting to know each other, and another version as an actual couple?

# Thoughts and Observations

          Kiarostami manages to masterfully condense fifteen years of marriage into a single day. He does this by visually presenting to us a film in which two strangers are spending a day getting to know each other. And we expect the dialogue to match that, but Kiarostami says no. Instead he subverts our idea of time as it relates to linear and non-linear storytelling. For example, most movies would use a time jump with dialogue that matches the period that is displayed onscreen. A couple shown in adolescence is expected to talk about, well, teen things. We don’t expect them to discuss being late picking up the kids or their late mortgage payments. In Certified Copy all that is thrown out the window, the timeline of their dialogue is incongruent to what we see during the span of the film. He isn’t trying to confuse you, he’s just purposefully leaving out details that would ground the film in space and time.


          What does it matter who these two are to each other really? Kiarostami isn’t here just to make another conventional romance film. The boy meets girl story is just to service a larger point he is trying to make.

          All works of art, including film are just copies, copies of our reality. Copies of our reality that have been altered by the artists choices. And these copies can allow us to experience a time period we weren’t born in, to admire the beauty of people who’ve long been gone,  and to feel an intense profound and self-less romantic love that might not even actually exist. To quote Shimell during a Q&A:

“… It’s a very interesting philosophical concept. That if the copy produces the exact same emotional aesthetic and intellectual response from you, then it might just as well be the original, and in fact it is indistinguishable from the original.”

          Aren’t our relationships just copies and clones of others past, present, and future? Perhaps courting rituals, technology, and language have changed throughout time. But the story of two people meeting and falling in and out of love hasn’t changed. The sexes have been trying to understand each other for as long as we have existed. Is it that we are too fragile to look in the mirror and see our own imperfections that we have to constantly point out flaws in our partners? Even with all the relationship columns and dating tips we have at our disposal in modern times, are we sure we really want to thoroughly understand each other anyways? Would that not ruin the act of being with another?


          There’s a scene early on in the film in which they are in a museum, Elle shows him a famous original copy of the painting of Polyhymnia. A group tour shuffles up to the front of the painting as the two back away and listen to the guide spiel about the the pieces’ history. The camera stays on faces of our main characters as Elle whispers and translates what the guide is explaining into James’ ear. Her whispers are inaudible as the guide speaks loudly just outside the frame. We see James hearing but not listening. He stays for a moment, his interest in the painting wanes, and soon leaves to seek interest elsewhere .

          It’s a beautifully crafted scene that utilizes sound design to encapsulate Kiarostamis’ belief of not needing to know everything, to just enjoy a piece of art or experience for what it is. And if anything, the facts and details take away the enjoyment of art and life itself.

# Final Thoughts

          Binoche is incredible in this film, her acting is so nuanced it helps reinforce the reality of turbulent relationships that Kiarostami is aiming for. William Shimell gives a fantastic performance as well, complimenting Binoche.

          Aesthetically, it’s probably easiest and best described as a lovechild between The Before Trilogy & In the Mood for Love.

          The ambiguous nature of both their relationship and dialogue makes for a film full of levity. Films like Certified Copy, ones that have no borders and aren’t concrete, have so much re-watch value. It’s the philosophical ideas that are presented to us with a familiar story of boy meets girl that I find enthralling and refreshing about it. Looking forward to exploring the rest of Kiarostami’s works.
