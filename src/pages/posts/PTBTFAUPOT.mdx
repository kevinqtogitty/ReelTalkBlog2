    Maybe I’ve got so used to watching arthouse and experimental films that I no longer have any idea what makes a good film anymore. Watching Preparations to Be Together for an Unknown Period of Time, really tested me on what I really enjoy about cinema. On one hand the plot of a top neurosurgeon returning home Budapest to meet the “love of her life“on Friendship Bridge, whom she had briefly met at a conference at New Jersey years ago, sounded like the idea for a shitty 2000’s romcom starring Katherine Heigl and Mathew McConaughey. Naturally I was skeptical. After finishing the film I had to see what others were saying, and was rewarded rather hilarious review on IMDB.

    I can't lie, I agree with what’s being said here. It’s true, in fact I too take red flags as a green light. It for sure has no resemblance to reality, and at times really did feel like I was watching two naive and awkward teenagers on-screen who at any moment were gonna make-out with way too much tongue (hey, we’ve all been there).

    But in a short Directors Intro found on YouTube, director Lili Horvat explains to us that the film is an exploration of how we each experience moments, in this case love, ﻿vastly differently. Is Vizy so lonely that she made this whole encounter up? Did they even exchange single word way back when? Is Drexler playing some kind of sick mind games to drive his love interest insane? And what’s the term for being turned on by a doctor who saved your father? None of these are answered in the film, and were literally left hanging by the end of the movie.

    Minus the slight lull in the film about halfway through, I see what Horvat is trying to achieve with this film and I do think it was well executed in that regard. Beautifully shot in the city of Budapest Horvat’s film takes us on the frustrating journey of finding love. Showing us how our very own minds and perceptions can play tricks on us, our beliefs, our memories, and how it can trap us in an endless mental maze.
