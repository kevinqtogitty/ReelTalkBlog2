## About

A film blog I ocassionaly run to host my thoughts on foreign/art films. This was built because I needed to migrate my work off of squarespace. This led met after I built my photography website I need to find the right tools to build my blog. 

This led me to the world of JAMstack applications, and to AstroJS in particular. I learned a lot about Island Architecture, hydration, file based routing, markdown/MDX, and server side rendering just by building a website to host static content

## Tools

- AstroJS
- Javascript
- React
- Vanilla CSS
- MDX

## Features

1. User can filter through archive of my posts, and it will immediately update as you're typing
2. Uses filebase routing
3. Blog posts are written in MDX
4. User can toggle between a card vs traditional archive list display
5. Uses formsubmit for keeping track of user emails and subscribing them to a newsletter


## Lessons

1. Understanding how filebased routing works
2. Understanding how layouts/slots work
3. Understanding partial hydration/server side rendering to deliver lightning fast content
4. Understanding the difference between client side rendering vs SSR
5. Understanding the direction web development is going as the industry aims to move from feature rich sites to delivering faster static websites
6. And how to write content in MDX which will be beneficial for writing documentation
